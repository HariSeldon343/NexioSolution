## Updated Tables

### eventi table
Added columns for PWA synchronization:
- `sync_status` - Track sync state (pending, synced, conflict, error)
- `offline_id` - Unique identifier for offline-created events
- `last_synced` - Timestamp of last successful sync
- `version` - Already existed, used for conflict resolution

## Existing Related Tables

### Already present:
- `push_subscriptions` - Web push notification subscriptions
- `sync_queue` - General sync queue (kept separate from calendar-specific)
- `task_calendario` - Task calendar integration
- `mobile_sync_stats` - Mobile sync statistics view

## Database Statistics

- Total PWA tables created: 9
- Total columns added to eventi: 3
- Foreign key constraints added: 17
- Indexes created: 45+
- Default preferences created: 5 user-company combinations

## Key Features Enabled

1. **Offline Support**
   - Full offline calendar functionality
   - Local data caching with expiration
   - Automatic sync when online

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Version-based conflict detection
   - Multiple resolution strategies
   - Manual conflict review option

3. **Advanced Reminders**
   - Multi-channel reminder delivery
   - Custom timing and priority
   - Retry logic for failed deliveries

4. **User Preferences**

## File Locations

- Setup SQL: `/database/pwa_calendar_setup.sql`
- Setup Script: `/scripts/setup-pwa-calendar.php`
- This Summary: `/database/PWA_CALENDAR_SETUP_SUMMARY.md`

## Next Steps

1. Implement PWA service worker for offline functionality
2. Create API endpoints for calendar sync operations
3. Build UI components for conflict resolution
4. Set up push notification infrastructure
5. Implement background sync for reminders

## Technical Notes

- All tables use InnoDB engine for transaction support
- UTF8MB4 charset for full Unicode support
- JSON columns for flexible data storage
- Comprehensive indexing for query performance
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test offline event creation and synchronization
2. Verify conflict resolution mechanisms
3. Test reminder delivery across channels
4. Validate preference synchronization
5. Check performance with large datasets
6. Test recurring event generation
7. Verify cache expiration and cleanup
